def update_pointing(smap, *, pointing_table):
    """
    Update the pointing information in the input map header.

    This function updates the pointing information in ``smap`` by
    updating the ``CRPIX1, CRPIX2, CDELT1, CDELT2, CROTA2`` keywords
    in the header using the information provided in ``pointing_table``.

    .. note::

        The method removes any ``PCi_j`` matrix keys in the header and
        updates the ``CROTA2`` keyword.

    .. warning::

        This function is only intended to be used on level 1 images,
        including cutouts/submaps. This function should be applied before
        rotating, resampling, rebinning, or interpolating the map in any
        way.

    Parameters
    ----------
    smap : `~sunpy.map.sources.AIAMap`
        Input map.
    pointing_table : `~astropy.table.QTable`
        Table of pointing information.
        You can get this table by calling `aiapy.calibrate.util.get_pointing_table`.

    Returns
    -------
    `~sunpy.map.sources.AIAMap`
        Updated map with pointing information.
