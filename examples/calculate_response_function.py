# Since AIA uses narrow-band filters, other wavelengths (outside of the nominal
# wavelength attributed to each filter) contribute to the image data.
# Computing these response functions allow us to see which other wavelengths
# contribute to the total intensity in each image.
#
# First, create a `~aiapy.response.Channel` object by specifying the
# wavelength of the channel. In this case, we'll
# choose the 335 Å channel, but this same workflow
# can be applied to any of the EUV or UV channels
# on AIA. This may take a few seconds the first time you do
# this as the most recent instrument data file will
# need to be downloaded from a remote server. Subsequent
# calls will know that the data has been downloaded.

# From `Boerner et al. (2012) <https://doi.org/10.1007/s11207-011-9804-8>`_,
# the wavelength response function is given by,
#
# .. math::
#   R(\lambda) = A_{geo}R_P(\lambda)R_S(\lambda)T_E(\lambda)T_F(\lambda)
#   D(\lambda)Q(\lambda)G(\lambda),
#
# where
#
# - :math:`A_{geo}` geometrical collecting area
# - :math:`R_P,R_S` reflectances of primary and secondary mirrors, respectively
# - :math:`T_E, T_F` transmission efficiency of the entrance and focal-plane
#   filters, respectively
# - :math:`D` contaminant transmittance of optics
# - :math:`Q` quantum efficiency of the CCD
# - :math:`G` gain of the CCD camera system
#
# The `~aiapy.response.Channel` object provides an interface to all of these
# properties of the telescope. Below, we show how to plot several of these
# properties as a function of wavelength.
