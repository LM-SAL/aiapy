Modeling Channel Degradation over Time
========================================

This example demonstrates how to model the degradation
of the AIA channels as a function of time over the entire
lifetime of the instrument.

###########################################################
# The sensitivity of the AIA channels degrade over time. Possible causes include
# the deposition of organic molecules from the telescope structure onto the
# optical elements and the decrease in detector sensitivity following (E)UV
# exposure. When looking at AIA images over the lifetime of the mission, it
# is important to understand how the degradation of the instrument impacts the
# measured intensity. For monitoring brightness changes over months and years,
# degradation correction is an important step in the data normalization proces.
# For instance, the SDO Machine Learning Dataset
# (`Galvez et al., 2019 <https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019ApJS..242....7G/abstract>`_)
# includes this correction.
#
# The AIA team models the change in transmission as a function of time (see
# `Boerner et al., 2012 <https://doi.org/10.1007/s11207-011-9804-8>`_) and
# the table of correction parameters is publicly available via the
# `Joint Science Operations Center (JSOC) <http://jsoc.stanford.edu/>`_.
#
# First, fetch this correction table. It is not strictly necessary to do this explicitly,
# but will significantly speed up the calculation by only fetching the table
# once.
correction_table = get_correction_table()

# We want to compute the degradation for each EUV channel.
channels = [94, 131, 171, 193, 211, 304, 335] * u.angstrom

# We can use the `~astropy.time` subpackage to create an array of times
# between now and the start of the mission with a cadence of one week.

now = astropy.time.Time.now()
time = time_0 + np.arange(0, (now - time_0).to(u.day).value, 7) * u.day

###########################################################
# Finally, we can use the `~aiapy.calibrate.degradation` function to
# compute the degradation for a particular channel and observation time.
# This is modeled as the ratio of the effective area measured at a particular
# calibration epoch over the uncorrected effective area with a polynomial
# interpolation to the exact time.
