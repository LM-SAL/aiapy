Fixes a bug in `~aiapy.calibrate.update_pointing` concerning how the row in 3-hourly
master pointing table is chosen.
Previously, the row with ``T_START`` closest to ``DATE_OBS`` was chosen.
Now, the row corresponding to ``T_OBS`` greater than or equal to ``T_START`` AND
less than ``T_STOP`` is chosen.
