Removed the need for CuPy in `aiapy.psf.calculate_psf` and `aiapy.psf.deconvolve`.
It has been replaced with `JAX <https://docs.jax.dev/en/latest/>`__ which enables faster CPU computations with optional GPU support.

This means that the performance of these calculations has been significantly improved on machines without a compatible NVIDIA GPU.
In early testing, it is around 15 times faster on the CPU compared to NumPy.

This means that the keyword, ``use_gpu``, in `aiapy.psf.calculate_psf` and `aiapy.psf.deconvolve` has been removed.
