Removed the need for CuPy in `aiapy.psf.psf`, it was replaced with Jax which enables faster CPU computations with optional GPU support.
This means that the performance of the PSF calculations will be significantly improved on machines without a compatible NVIDIA GPU.
In early testing, it is around 15 times faster on the CPU compared to NumPy.

This means that the keyword, ``use_gpu``, in `aiapy.psf.psf` has been removed.
