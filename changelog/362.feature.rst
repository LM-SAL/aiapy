Modify :func:`~aiapy.calibrate.update_pointing` to allow for updating pointing information
of maps that have been cropped. This function no longer raises an exception if the input map
does not include the full Sun or is not at the expected resolution. A warning is now raised
if the plate scale is significantly different (:math:`>1\%`) than the expected plate scale.
